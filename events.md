**Stay Connected with Remote Workers in Rhode Island**

WorkFromRI will soon host events to bring together remote professionals from across the state! Whether you’re looking to network, learn new skills, or just unwind with others who work remotely, we’re excited to create opportunities for Rhode Island’s remote workforce to connect.

**What to Expect:**

- **Virtual Meetups:** Connect from anywhere! These online events will cover topics like remote work productivity, work-life balance, and industry-specific insights from local experts.
- **Local Gatherings:** In the future, we’ll be hosting in-person meetups and coworking days. These gatherings will be a great way to meet fellow remote workers, discover new work-friendly spaces, and enjoy all that Rhode Island has to offer.
