# About WorkFromRI

**Our Mission**

WorkFromRI is here to build a supportive community for remote workers in Rhode Island, or folks thinking about joining us here. We connect remote professionals, inspire new ideas, and promote the unique advantages of working from the Ocean State.

**Founder’s Story**

Hi neighbor! I’m [Eric Humphrey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejhumphrey/), a remote tech professional and Rhode Island resident. With over 15 years of remote work experience, I know the unique rewards and challenges it brings. I created WorkFromRI to bring together remote workers like myself who want to connect, learn, and make the most of working and living in Rhode Island.

**Why Rhode Island?**

From its stunning coastlines to its vibrant communities, Rhode Island offers a high quality of life and a supportive environment for remote workers. Whether you're a long-time Rhode Islander, new to the state, or thinking about relocating, we’re excited to have you join us!
